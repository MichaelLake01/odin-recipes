    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>Creole seasoning</li>
        <li>chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Preheat</h4>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Marinate</h4>
            <p>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Bake</h4>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Let Cool</h4>
            <p>Remove chicken to plate.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Add Broth</h4>
            <p>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Serve</h4>
            <p>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
